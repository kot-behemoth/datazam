# Datazam
An experiment in lean, local dev-capable data stacks

## Goals

- Local-first development for the entire stack.
- Support companies that can't afford heavy, expensive data tools or large teams.
- ONCE - style pricing approach. No monthly / usage fees
- No "SSO tax" - all tools should be either fully free, or affordable once deployed in serious prod use case.
- No k8s, so a small data team can be self-sufficient .
